<p>This document gives an overview

of the PS3 Linux kernel and&nbsp;device drivers.</p>





<h2>Overview</h2>





<p>The Linux kernel runs on the top of the PS3

hypervisor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most

devices and system resources are virtualized by the hypervisor. Linux

device drivers have been created and/or modified to work with

virtualized

devices.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fig.1 illustrates structure of Linux Kernel and

device drivers.</p>

Fig. 1 Structure of the PS3 Linux kernel

</p>





<p>The Linux kernel can access some devices directly (e.g. USB host

controllers).&nbsp;&nbsp;Other devices are virtualized by hypervisor

and device service is provided via hypervisor calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;For

example, storage service hypervisor calls are

available.&nbsp;&nbsp;See following sections for detail.</p>





<h2>Platform Specific Devices</h2>





<h3>Storage (Module name: ps3disk/ps3rom/ps3flash)</h3>





<p>PS3 storage devices includes HDD, Blu-ray Disc drive (BD drive) and

flash ROM.&nbsp;&nbsp;These devices are connected via Cell Broadband Engine.&#8217;s

companion chip.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accessing these devices is performed by

dedicated hypervisor calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;These hypervisor calls consist

of simple straightforward methods: open, close, read, write and

ioctl.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of all methods are asynchronous, that is,

methods will return immediately after call, and then the caller must

wait for its completion via other method.&nbsp;&nbsp;These completions

are notified by virtualized interrupts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of

results of these asynchronous methods can be retrieved via the

specific hypervisor call.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the BD drive is basically

ATAPI device, Linux can issue ATAPI commands by hypervisor

ioctl.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of ATAPI commands have been rejected by the

hypervisor because of security issues.</p>





<p>PS3 Linux Disk storage driver is a block device driver(Module name:

ps3disk). So the built-in HDD is accessed as /dev/ps3da. PS3 Linux

BD/DVD/CD-ROM storage driver is implemented just like the usb storage

driver does(Module name ps3rom).&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, the driver behaves

as SCSI host

controller driver and the storage devices themselves are as SCSI

devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;So the built-in BD drive is accessed as SCSI

&nbsp;CD-ROM, like

/dev/sr0.&nbsp; The PS3 Linux FLASH ROM storage driver is a misc

character divice driver(Module name: ps3flash).&nbsp;&nbsp;

FLASH ROM is accessed as /dev/ps3flash.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The Storage probe code uses a thread that keeps on scanning for new

devices, until no new device has shown up in the last 60 seconds.</p>





<h3>Audio (Module name: snd_ps3)</h3>





<p>PS3 Audio hardware can be divided into two parts; front end part and

back end part.</p>





<p>The front end part is PS3 audio chip itself, the back end part consists

HDMI driver chip, digital to analog converter for AV Multi interface,

Optical Digital Out (IEC60958/SPDIF) device and base clock generators

for 44.1KHz/48KHz audio clocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Front end chip can be

controlled by guest OSes through conventional register

access.&nbsp;&nbsp;To gain the access of these registers the guest OS

must issue dedicated hypervisor call and then ioremap.&nbsp;&nbsp;The front

end chip has simple structure, which reads(DMAs) PCM data into its

buffer and put them out with specified clock and format.&nbsp;&nbsp;No

special hardware to support to decode compressed audio, like MP3, is

equipped.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike AC97, the front end chip does not have

volume control.&nbsp;&nbsp; Guest OSes should modify supplying digital

PCM audio data into the chip if it wants to control volume.</p>





<p>The back end audio devices are completely controlled by called

&#8216;AV setting driver&#8217;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting up sample

frequency and data format consistently between back end and front end

is the role of the AV setting driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the AV setting

driver resides behind hypervisor, guest OS should use virtual UART to

communicate with it.</p>





<p>The Linux driver for this audio is composed under ALSA driver

framework, not OSS.</p>





<h3>Graphics/Video (Module name: ps3fb)</h3>





<p>PS3 has a powerful graphic processing unit with high speed host

connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPU is connected to both HDMI and AV multi

interface.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the GPU is connected directly to CBE,

no direct access by guest OSes to the GPU is allowed

currently.&nbsp;&nbsp;Video mode/format setting is also the role of AV

setting driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;PS3 Linux fb driver calls AV setting driver

to setup video modes.</p>





<p>Currently X server uses virtual frame buffer to render its

image.&nbsp;&nbsp; No hardware acceleration is supported under

Linux.&nbsp;&nbsp;See the description above section.</p>





<h3>Giga Bit Ethernet(GbE) (Module name: ps3_gelic)</h3>





<p>PS3 has built-in giga bit ethernet controller.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike

conventional PC&#8217;s ethernet controllers, it is not a PCI

device.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is connected to companion chip

directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;To access or setup the chip, guest OSes should

use dedicated hypervisor calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;This controller has its

dedicated DMA controller, thus transferring data is automatically

sent/received without PPE interventions.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also

dedicated hypervisor call to set up DMAC.</p>





<p>VLAN framework is internally used for the built-in

controller.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, conventional VLAN can&#8217;t be

used.&nbsp;&nbsp;PROMISC network mode is not supported with this

controller.</p>





<h3>Wireless &nbsp;</h3>





<p>Some models of PS3 have built-in 802.11b/g wireless
  hardware.&nbsp;&nbsp; It supports hadware encryption/decryption of WEP, TKIP
  and CCMP(AES) so that PS3 can connect to WPA and WPA2
  APs.&nbsp;&nbsp; This wireless does not support ad-hoc mode nor
  monitor mode.
</p>
<p>
This wireless chip behaves just like a phy chip
  connected to ethernet controller.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, interrupts and
  tx/rx hardware queues are shared among gigabit
  ethernet and wireless and GuestOS can not handle any
  raw 802.11 frames.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the wireless part has no
  separate MAC address, the ethernet and wireless uses same MAC
  address. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Guest OS should insert VLAN tag to select destination 'phy',
  i.e. ethernet or wireless for outgoing packets.&nbsp;&nbsp; For incoming
  packets, the hypervisor and the hardware inserts dedicated VLAN tag
  in received packets.
</p>
<p>
Linux support for wireless is integrated into ethernet driver
 'ps3_gelic'.&nbsp;&nbsp; The control interface is designed to use
 standard Linux's Wireless Extension.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus standard
 Linux wireless managing tools, wireless_tools, wpa_supplicant etc
 should work on this driver.&nbsp;&nbsp; As PS3 Linux kernel runs in
 64bit mode, systemcalls from 32bit userland program is passed via
 compatible layer of Linux kernel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there are some
 issues for wireless extension in this compat layer, 32bit wireless
 managing tools may not work well.
</p>
<p>
PS3 low model has no wireless.
</p>





<h3>USB</h3>





<p>The PS3 is equipped with industry standard USB EHCI host controllers

and companion OHCI host controllers, and optionally an internal high speed USB

hub. In this case, the USB ports on the front panel connect to the internal hub, and

not to the USB host controllers directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;The host

controllers are represented as devices on the hypervisor SB

bus.&nbsp;&nbsp;The PS3 Linux support implements the minimal

EHCI and OHCI driver 'bus glues' as needed by the standard Linux USB

driver stack.</p><h3>Game PAD</h3>





<p>PS3 game pad has both USB mode and Bluetooth

mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;Enabling each mode depends on the timing of pressing

PS button, which resides in the center of the pad.</p>





<p>In USB mode, although it almost conforms to USB HID specification,

it requires special USB request to enable sending HID data

(reports).&nbsp;&nbsp; The generic USB HID driver is modified to

support this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is just HID device, information of

the device is retrieved by standard HID device node, like

/dev/input/js0, /dev/input/event0 and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluetooth mode

is not supported by Linux.</p>





<h3>Memory card reader/writer</h3>





<p>Built-in memory card reader/writer supports Memory Stick,

CompactFlash and SD.&nbsp;&nbsp;The controller is a high speed USB

device and conforms to the USB Mass Storage

specification.&nbsp;&nbsp;The

generic USB Mass Storage driver of Linux can support this device

without modification.&nbsp;&nbsp; The device is connected to a root

port of the

EHCI controller.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because each card slot behaves logical

unit (LUN), the Linux driver can support all slots simultaneously.</p>





<h3>Bluetooth</h3>





<p>PS3 has built in USB Bluetooth host controller which conforms to

Bluetooth host controller interface specification, so generic hci_usb

Linux driver can handle the host controller.&nbsp;&nbsp;The controller

is high speed USB device and connected to directly to an internal EHCI root

port.</p>





<p>Paring between Bluetooth device and host is maintained on a per OS

basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, Linux paring information&nbsp;does not

propagate to the Game OS, and vice versa.</p>





<h3>Real Time Clock</h3>





<p>Similar to a PC, a built-in real time clock (RTC) keeps the wall

clock time for the PS3. The RTC is backed up by a battery and

so&nbsp;ticks&nbsp;even if external

power is removed.&nbsp; The RTC value can be read by a hypervisor

call, but it can not be written.&nbsp;&nbsp; The RTC value

monotonically increases

and never rolls back.</p>





<p>The PS3 Linux platform support uses the standard RTC userland

interface

/dev/rtc, The standard hwclock command can be used to manage the RTC.

Since the RTC is read only, the PS3 Linux platform support maintaines a

value in system flash memory that represents the difference between the

hardware RTC value and the Linux RTC value.</p>





<h2>How to build PS3 Linux kernel</h2>





<p>The Linux kernel can be compiled as follows:</p><p>Linux kernel 2.6.25.4

</p>





<ul><li>Extract the Linux Kernel source

    <p style="line-height: 100%; font-family: monospace; margin-left: 40px;">

$ tar jxf linux-2.6.25.4-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2<br>

$ cd linux-2.6.25.4-YYYYMMDD <br>

$ make ps3_defconfig </p>

  </li><li>You can change the kernel configuration by editing .config file</li><li> You can start compiling Linux kernel as follows.

    <p style="line-height: 100%; font-family: monospace; margin-left: 40px;">

$ make </p>

This generates a kernel image file named vmlinux.

  </li></ul>





<h2>Delivered Linux Kernel and Mainlining Activities</h2>





<p>Work is ongoing to improve Linux kernel support for the PS3 by

dedicated staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;One goal is to make the mainline kernel have

full support for PS3.
</p>





<p>Since the release of the linux-2.6.16 PS3 support to Linux

distributors for use in PS3 release day distributions, there has been

continuous work to cleanup the source code, with significant parts

completely re-worked to properly interface with appropriate kernel

infrastructures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Linux kernel development effort is shifting to

device drivers and the perfomance monitor.
</p>





<p>Following the public release of the PS3 game console, Linux kernel

maintenance for the PS3 will continue publicly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Source code

is available for public download at <A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/geoff/cell/">www.kernel.org</A>.
